Contains all results for food color.
* "food color 10 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB
   when 10 classes were used. 
* "food color 3 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB 
   when 3 classes : high, medium and low were used.
* "food color ANN 10 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for simple ANN in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB when 10 classes
   were used. Here the features are only mean values of color channels.
* "food color ANN 3 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for simple ANN in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB when 3 classes: high, medium and low
   were used. Here the features are only mean values of color channels.
* "food color CNN 10 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for simple CNN in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB when 10 classes
   were used. Here the features are all the pixel values from downsampled images only.
* "food color CNN 3 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for simple CNN in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB when 3 classes: high, medium and low
   were used. Here the features are all the pixel values from downsampled images only.
*  "single_channel_only" contains experiments for simple ANN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM in 3 color space when a single channel mean is used as feature.
* "food color trained tests on different camera and light" contains the results of test sets for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM in three color spaces.
   Used for comparing models in different light and camera conditions.
