Contains all results for food color.
* "pesticide 10 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB
   when 10 classes were used. 
* "pesticide 3 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB 
   when 3 classes : high, medium and low were used.
* "pesticide ANN 10 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for simple ANN in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB when 10 classes
   were used. Here the features are only mean values of color channels.
* "pesticide ANN 3 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for simple ANN in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB when 3 classes: high, medium and low
   were used. Here the features are only mean values of color channels.
* "pesticide CNN 10 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for simple CNN in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB when 10 classes
   were used. Here the features are all the pixel values from downsampled images only.
* "pesticide CNN 3 classes" contains the results of cross-validation and test set for simple CNN in three color spaces: RGB, HSV, LAB when 3 classes: high, medium and low
   were used. Here the features are all the pixel values from downsampled images only.
*  "single_channel_only" contains experiments for simple ANN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM in 3 color space when a single channel mean is used as feature.
